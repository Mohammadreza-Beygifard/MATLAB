These files are for simulating and studying Chua Circuit. [MATLAB_ver R2019b]

The [Chua_circ.m] file is a MATLAB function that implements the
state space equation of the circuit.

[lab_1_ex_1.m] will find the equilibrium points of the circuit
and checks their stability by calculating the eigen values of State Matrix
of the linearized system around each equlibrium point.

[lab_1_ex_2.m] uses the simulink model [lab1_sim.slx] for generating the signals
and the trajectory of the states of the system.

[Controllers] in this folder you can find four different control approach for 
controlling such a nonlinear system.
