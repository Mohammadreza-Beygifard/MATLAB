# Space_Rendezvous
One of the main problems in space technologies is letting a chaser, which can be a space craft,
reach a target, which can be a satelite that needs repairments.

This problem is highly nonlinear and typical constraints such as fuel consumption or safety spheres around
the seeker involves in it.

To solve such a problem we can use Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations for modeling the plant (the chaser)
and use non-linear MPC to control the chaser.

In this example which is a lab activity we have modeled the plant and performed the simulation.

By running main_HCW.m you can see the results.
