As a homework for a course named tecnologies for autonomous vehicles, I have designed an adaptive cruise control.

I would like to share this controller with you. In the report you can find additional information about the controller.

Adaptive Cruise Control is an enhanced cruise control that can manage the velocity of the vehicle in different scenarios,
like obstacles, pedestrians and changing the speed of a leading vehicle. in this example we are testing the systems for the
change in the speed of the leading vehicle scenario.

Adaptive Cruise Control is a complicated control system consists of usually more than 5 different controllers.

In this simplified model we are implementing three controllers, as velocity control, spacing control and a control logic to choose
between them.
